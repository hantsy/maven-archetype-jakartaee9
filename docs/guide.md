# Generate a Jakarta EE 9 project skeleton from Maven archetype

I have created a [jakartaee9-starter-boilerplate](https://github.com/hantsy/jakartaee9-starter-boilerplate) repository for developers to building a Jakarta EE 9 project simply, you can read the [articles](https://hantsy.github.io/jakartaee9-starter-boilerplate/) I have written for the codes.

I shared this project in the official Jakarta EE  community mail list, and got that [Eclipse EE4J starter](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/starter) project has planned to provide a custom starter template for Jakarta EE 9. I was suggested to create a Maven archetype as a start point to share my work in the starter project. So I created [another Maven archetype for Jakarta EE 9 repository](https://github.com/hantsy/maven-archetype-jakartaee9) for this purpose. At the moment I wrote down this post, this maven archetype has been approved to upload to the Maven Central Repository.

> The work of this maven archetype project is being ported to Eclipse EE4J Starter, see: [eclipse-ee4j/starter#63](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/starter/pull/63).

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed  the following software.

* Java 8 
* [Apache Maven 3.6](https://maven.apache.org)
* [GlassFish v6.0](https://glassfish.org)

> Java 11 is becoming the mainstream version, but GlassFish v6.0 is still stick on Java 8, Java 11 support is planned in  the upcoming v6.1 and Jakarta EE 9.1. I will update it to Java 11 when Jakarta EE 9.1 is released.

## Generate project skeleton

Open your terminal, run the following command to generate a Jakarta EE 9 project skeleton.

```bash
> mvn -B  archetype:generate \
-DarchetypeGroupId=io.github.hantsy \
-DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-jakartaee9  \
-DarchetypeVersion=1.0  \
-DgroupId=com.example \
-Dpackage=com.example.demo \
-DartifactId=myapp \
-Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT 
```

Currently I only published the released version to  Maven Central repository. 

To experience the Github Packages feature,  I also deployed the next `1.1-SNAPSHOT` version to Github Packages registry. If you want to use the latest version, add the following repositories config in your `~/.m2/settings.xml`. 

```xml
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>github-public</id>
    <url>https://public:&#48;28d0c8f723084e499eb87a6fe173b3af295d618@maven.pkg.github.com/hantsy/*</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```

Once the project is generated, switch to the project root.

```bash
cd mypp
```

Import the source codes into your IDEs, such as NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA, etc. you will see the following project structure.

```bash
├── pom.xml
└── src
    ├── main
    │   ├── java
    │   │   └── com
    │   │       └── example
    │   │           └── demo
    │   │               ├── GreetingMessage.java
    │   │               ├── GreetingResource.java
    │   │               ├── GreetingService.java
    │   │               └── JaxrsActivator.java
    │   └── resources
    │       └── META-INF
    │           └── beans.xml
    └── test
        ├── java
        │   └── com
        │       └── example
        │           └── demo
        │               ├── GreetingResourceTest.java
        │               └── GreetingServiceTest.java
        └── resources
            └── arquillian.xml
```

1. The *pom.xml* is the project Maven  model file.
2. In the *src/main/java*,  there are 4 classes, `GreetingMessage` is a simple POJO to present a message string, `GreetingResource` is a Jakarta REST  resource,  `GreetingService` is a simple CDI bean to build `GreetingMessage`. `JaxrsActivator` is used for activating the Jakarta REST support.
3. In the *src/main/resources* folder, there is an empty `beans.xml`, which is the standard configuration file of CDI beans, but became optional since Java EE 7.
4. In the *src/test/java*, there are two test classes,  `GreetingServiceTest` is to test `GreetingService`,  `GreetingResourceTest` is to test `GreetingResource`.
5. In the *src/test/resources* folder, there is an `arquillian.xml` which is the configuration file of Arquillian testing framework.

You can simply run the application using the following command.

```bash
> mvn clean package cargo:run

```

This command performs a series of tasks for you.

1. Firstly it cleans and builds the project into a war package.
2. Then use cargo maven plugin to download a copy of Glassfish v6.0, and extract the files in the project build folder.
3. Then create a new `cargo-dommain` for this project and start it immediately. 
4. After the Glassfish is running, then deploy the packaged application to the Glassfish.

> You can check the *server.log* file in *myqpp/target/glassfish6x-home/cargo-domain/logs* to view the details of server startup and application deployment.

Open another terminal window,  try to test the sample REST API endpoint.

```bash
> curl http://localhost:8080/myapp/api/greeting/JakartaEE
{"message":"Say Hello to JakartaEE at 2021-03-31T16:32:39.216"}
```

Compare to my [jakartaee9-starter-boilerplate](https://github.com/hantsy/jakartaee9-starter-boilerplate)  project, the maven archetype provides a quicker approach to experience the Jakarta EE 9 stack.

To stop the running application, send a `CTRL+C` shortcut in the original terminal.

```bash
[INFO] Press Ctrl-C to stop the container...
[INFO] [talledLocalContainer] GlassFish 6.0.0 is stopping...
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------

```

## Run Sample Tests

The generated project includes two simple JUnit/Arquilian test classes to demonstrate techniques of testing CDI bean and REST API.

To run the sample testing codes. 

1. Firstly make sure there is a running Glassfish server, check  [Testing Jakarta EE 9 Applications with GalssFish 6](https://github.com/hantsy/jakartaee9-starter-boilerplate/blob/master/docs/arq-glassfish.md).

2. Then run the following command.

    ```bash
    mvn clean verify -DskipTests=false
    ```

Next you can begin to add your codes to enrich the application.
